  Fitness Recommendation Application
</h2>

<p>This app aims to help users discover their preferred forms of exercise by offering features such as step tracking, a body mass index (BMI) calculator, and motivational recommendations. The primary goal of the app is to suggest suitable activities tailored to the user's condition, which is determined through a series of questions. Based on the user's responses, the app will display guided videos sourced from YouTube via API integration.</p>
